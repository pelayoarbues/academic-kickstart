Fundamentals of Data Science is a collection of selected resources aimed at providing a solid background for aspiring and junior Data Scientists. The objective is to create a list as small and powerful as possible. There are thousands of sources out there and it is sometimes difficult to focus on what's important.

The list is open for new submissions and changes so I keep it updated on the following Notion Link:
